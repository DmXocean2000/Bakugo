Smokescreen gives deku the ability to produce smoke from his body that can spread to cover a very wide area. Gearshift allows deku to change the speed at which things accelerate through space. Bestowal is the base of one for all that allows someone to pass their quirk on to next person at their will. One for all stock piles while this transfers all of them. Fa jin allows the user to build kinetic energy by performing repetitive movements and can choose how to release the burst of speed and power. Damn it deku stop getting all of this power!||",
