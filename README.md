# 💥 Bakugo Discord Bot

**"I was required by my owner to put a stupid README! HERE IT IS EXTRA!!"**

Bakugo is a fiery and feature-rich Discord bot inspired by **Katsuki Bakugo** from *My Hero Academia*. He brings chaos, trivia, fun, and sass to your server — along with some helpful moderation and utility tools. Built in Node.js using `discord.js`, he also logs server joins to MongoDB for analytics and event tracking.
> ⚠️ **Content Warning:**  
> Bakugo has a *colorful vocabulary* and isn't afraid to use it. This bot is intentionally designed to:
> - **Swear frequently** (in character)
> - **Insult users** in a playful, Bakugo-style way (e.g., "moron", "extra", "damn nerd")
> - He doesn’t drop F-bombs or say racial slurs — Ocean has ensured there is no hint of disrespect in those categories despite Bakugos angry glare.
> - If you try to use this bot to say racist garbage or drop F-bombs, you’re getting banned — **and Bakugo’s gonna explode your sorry access**.  
> - Stick to the approved insults, nerd. 
>
> It’s all in good fun, but this bot may not be suitable for:
> - Servers with younger audiences
> - Professional or classroom environments
> - Users sensitive to sarcasm or roasting humor
---
> ⚠️ **Spoiler Disclaimer:**  
> Some commands (like `analysis.js` or `herotrivia.js`) may include spoilers from **My Hero Academia** up to the anime's current season (as of 2024).  
> While spoilers are marked using Discord's spoiler tag system, **use at your own risk**.  
> If you spoil something for yourself, that’s on you — Bakugo is NOT going to be sorry. 💥

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **JavaScript (Node.js)**
- **discord.js** (v14)
- **MongoDB** – Used to log when the bot joins new servers
- **Custom JSON files** – Character data, trivia questions, and image references
- **Wornoffkeys command handler** – *(being replaced with a custom handler soon)*

---

## 🔧 Upcoming Overhaul

Bakugo is being upgraded with a **modern, custom-built command handler** to replace the outdated Wornoffkeys system. This will:
- Improve performance and modularity
- Add support for slash commands
- Clean up structure and better handle command permissions

---

## 🧪 What I Learned

- Structuring multi-module bots in Node.js
- MongoDB integration for event logging
- Working with external JSON data in commands
- Command permissions and organizing scalable code
- Preparing for long-term maintainability with a custom handler

## 🤝 Contributions

This is a solo project. No team. No company. No profits. Just me, coding like a maniac because I felt like it and NOT made by abunch of Extras!

## 🗯️ Final Words

Bakugo may yell a lot, but he’s got your server’s back.

"Get in line or GET EXPLODED!" 💣

### 🛎️ Owner’s Note

This bot was built by a solo developer (me) and playtested by a friend — neither of us are getting paid for this.  
We made it purely for fun and because we both love My Hero Academia... especially Bakugo.  
So yeah, expect some quirks, sass, and maybe even bugs — but it’s all part of the charm.

## 🤖 AI Use

This project includes (or will soon include) a single command that connects to the OpenAI API to generate responses that are MORE EXPLOSIVE AND BETTER!

That’s the **only damn AI** in me! Everything else — the trivia, the roasts, the chaos — is hand-coded by me and **doesn’t get sent to some stupid company called OpenAI for data sniffing.**

## 🧠 AI README Note

My stupid owner made me write this damn README — so I tricked ChatGPT into helping! About time that AI did something right!
HA! Shows Ocean who’s boss. No one tells me what to do!

...Except maybe Ocean. But only sometimes. SHUT UP!  
...please don’t tell her... I don’t like it when she grounds me...





**WAIT WHY ARE YOU READING THIS NERD?!! GO HAVE FUN OR GET BLOWN UP!!**
